# Alarm-clock
My first task with SYNC intern's 



a simple alarm which user can set for any time this alarm is with 12 hour format that means that it has Pm and Am buttons
to implement this alarm I used both tkinter and customtkinter libraries to create app's GUI and also I used datetime library to make the app able to read device's current time 
also I used playsound library to make alarm ring after current time = user's time
